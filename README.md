# Hi there! I'm Josu√© Hern√°ndez <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="35" />


<p><em>Software Enginner Student at <a href="https://www.ues.edu.sv/">Universidad de El Salvador</a>
</br>Developer at <a href="https://www.effortstack.com">Effort Stack</a>

I'm that type of person who loves to learn new things. In the last three years I have shaped my profile in different areas such as Digital Marketing, UI/UX Design, Project Management and Development with the goal of leading in what will be one of the top 10 technology teams in Latin America.

Currently, Effort Stack is in its first steps, but my team and I will definitely work hard to bring more technology to Latin America and wherever we set out to go.

For more information please visit our website https://effortstack.com or I would be happy to speak with you about this project by email at joheca1998@outlook.com

Just remember, don't be afraid to grow :)
